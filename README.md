# Groove plugin for MuseScore

This is a
[plugin](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/developers-handbook/plugins-3x)
for [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) 3.x which can be used to make playback
"groove" or "swing" in countless different musical styles, e.g.

- Jazz
- Brazilian samba
- Viennese waltz
- Morrocan Gnawa
- Other micro-rhythms (e.g. see [this article](https://canthisevenbecalledmusic.com/advanced-mathematics-2-microrhythms/))

Unlike most other approaches to swing, this plugin can alter not only
the timing and duration of notes, but also their dynamics.  This can
make a surprisingly large improvement to the realism of the feel of
the groove.

## Examples

This repository contains some examples:

- [The A section of "Scrapple From The Apple"](examples/Scrapple/),
  a bebop jazz tune by Charlie Parker.  You can also [view / listen to
  this on musescore.com](https://musescore.com/user/3898956/scores/6114206/s/Bf73QN).

- [An excerpt from "Crimson Waves"](examples/Crimson+Waves/) by
  Malcolm Braff, as described in [this
  article](https://canthisevenbecalledmusic.com/advanced-mathematics-2-microrhythms/)

## Usage

As the plugin is currently in alpha, it is not generally usable yet, but
experienced MuseScore developers should have no problem trying it out,
and maybe other experienced MuseScore users can too.

## Long-term vision

Ultimately I hope to see this re-implemented natively within MuseScore
as a significant extension of [its existing swing
functionality](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/swing) so that no
plugin is required.  This should facilitate more user-friendly and
more powerful workflows.

## Acknowledgements

The design of this plugin was heavily influenced by discussions with,
and advice from [Barak
Schmool](https://www.ram.ac.uk/about-us/staff/barak-schmool), a
composer, saxophonist, percussionist, and expert in world rhythms who
teaches at several London music conservatoires and counts [Jacob
